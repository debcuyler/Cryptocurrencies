# Cryptocurrencies
This exercise is to classify cryptocurrencies into groups so they can be assessed for a new investment by Accountablity Accounting, a prominent investment bank.

Unsupervised learning was used to cluster the data and reduce the dimensions. The data was then used with a clustering algorithm with visualizations created to share findings with the board of Accountablity Accounting.
